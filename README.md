# pomostrike-timer

Pomostrike Timer is a Pomodoro timer (25 min blocks) with alarms that play the tunes from the Tokyo and Tohuku Station Chimes used in Japan. It sets a more calm and peaceful setting to transition from work to break (and vice-versa).

## This is a pomodoro timer that I created for myself and wanted to share to my fellow pomodoro enthusiasts

I didn't find a niche pomodoro timer that had the chimes from the Japanese stations. So i created one on my own!

Granted, I am not a full stack web developer, but hey for a POC, this is kinda nice...

Please enjoy the peaceful serenity of doing pomodoros and please let me know if you find any bugs


wouldnt dismiss me man
